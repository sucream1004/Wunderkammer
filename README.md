# Wunderkammer

- This is the Wunderkammer that I am collecting treasures.
- Focusing on XR experience that can impact on an artist's side.

## Objet
- Relationship between an attribute and physical shape.
- An observer sees an objet and has a certain relationship with it.
- In daily life, any object recall emotions, memories or a moment can be the objet (Personal Thought!).
- Customized VR environment can maximize a someone's feeling, experience or memory.
- Jobs describing emotions likewise most of artistic works has beneficial effects of "objet" oriented VR environment (I believe).

## Modern/Contemporary Dance
- Contemporary dance stresses versatility and improvisation, unlike the strict, structured nature of ballet. [Link](https://www.liveabout.com/what-is-contemporary-dance-1007423)
- In the early days, it was called free dance, expreshing dance, and in Germany, it was called Neui Tantz.
- Focusing on more on emotional and physical expression rather than formal techniques.

## Experiment on a Character (Based on real person)
- The main character (for the customized VR environment) has had suffered from depression.
- Passing a long tunnel (Description of depression by her).
